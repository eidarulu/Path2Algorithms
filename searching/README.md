# Explanation of searching algorithms

Binary search only works when your list is in sorted order.

### Searching Algorithms

- **Binary Search**:  
  Efficient for searching in sorted datasets by repeatedly halving the search space.  
  - Time complexity: **O(log n)**  
  - Use case: Finding elements in a sorted array quickly.
