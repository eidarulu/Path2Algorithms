# Explanation of sorting algorithms

This folder contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Python:

1. **Bubble Sort** (`bubble_sort.py`)
2. **Quick Sort** (`quick_sort.py`)

### Sorting Algorithms

- **Merge Sort**:  
  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array and merges sorted halves.  
  - Time complexity: **O(n log n)**  
  - Space complexity: **O(n)**  
  - Best for: Stable sorting of large datasets.

- **Quick Sort**:  
  A partitioning algorithm that sorts in place.  
  - Time complexity: **O(n log n)** (average), **O(nÂ²)** (worst)  
  - Space complexity: **O(log n)**  
  - Best for: Small to medium datasets, when space is limited.

## How to Run

```bash
python bubble_sort.py
