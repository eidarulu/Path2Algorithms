# Path2Algorithms

Welcome to my **Path2Algorithms** repository!<br>
This repository serves as my personal learning journal, where I document the algorithms I’ve studied and implemented I have learned during my **university algorithms course** and while reading the book _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Bhargava. I created it primarily for myself, as a way to solidify and track my understanding of key concepts. At the same time, I hope it can demonstrate my commitment to mastering algorithms and provide others with insight into my learning process. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!

## Introduction

Algorithms implemented in Python & Kotlin. The algorithms are categorized by type (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms), and each language has its own folder.

## Course Algorithms

Algorithms learned in the **university course**:

- **Sorting**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- **Searching**: Binary Search
- **Graph Traversal**: BFS, DFS
- **Recursion and Backtracking**

For each algorithm, I provide:
- **Time and space complexity**.
- **Step-by-step explanation**.
- **Practical use cases**.

## Book Algorithms

Algorithms from _Grokking Algorithms_:

- **Binary Search**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- **Greedy Algorithms**

Implemented in **Kotlin** and **Python** for comparison.

## Project Structure

Each folder contains subfolders for different algorithm types (e.g., sorting, searching).

## Future Plans

- Implement more advanced algorithms from upcoming **Advanced Algorithms** courses.
- Add explanations for **algorithm design paradigms** like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, and Greedy algorithms.
- Refine the code to be **interview-ready** and share it publicly on GitHub.

## Project Structure

- `python/`: Contains Python implementations of algorithms.
- `kotlin/`: Contains Kotlin implementations of algorithms.

### Algorithm Categories:
- **Sorting**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort
- **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS

## How to Run

### Python
```bash
# Navigate to the python folder
cd python/sorting
python bubble_sort.py
