# Explanation of graph algorithms

### Graph Algorithms

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**:  
  Explores graph layer by layer, useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.  
  - Time complexity: **O(V + E)** (V: vertices, E: edges)

- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**:  
  Explores as deep as possible along branches before backtracking.  
  - Time complexity: **O(V + E)**  
  - Use case: Topological sorting, detecting cycles.
